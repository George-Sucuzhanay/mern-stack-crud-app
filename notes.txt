Creating a MERN Full-Stack Web Application

Creating our Backend:

1) mkdir <filename>
2) npm init -y
3) mkdir controllers db models routes seed
4) touch db/index.js models/item.js routes/index.js controllers/index.js seed/items.js
5) touch app.js server.js
6) npm i express mongoose cors morgan nodemon

db/Index.js
this is where our connection to our database is made
1) import mongoose
2) Declare MONGODB_URL variable

models/item.js
this is our schema structure

seed/items.js
this is where our data is stored

app.js
this is our server logic 

server.js
this is where we will start our server

controllers/index.js
this controls the actions for our CRUD
Controllers establish a connection between the router and models

and where we will run our crud functions back to our mongodb database

Side Notes:
- Version 5 of mongoose is more widely used at this moment


Front End:

npx create-react-app client
